### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm a journalist from Brazil, but living in Cork, Ireland. Iâ€™m problem-solver driven to help others to achieve their best. Iâ€™m dedicated, curious, persistent and I strongly believe in life long learning. Iâ€™m always looking to improve my abilities to give my best, to continue growing and helping everyone who works with me.
